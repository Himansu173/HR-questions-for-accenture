        <h2>1. Introduce yourself</h2>
        <p>My name is Himansu Sekhar Lenka. I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Application at Silicon
            University, with a CGPA of 9.17. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and Management from
            Utkal University, where I graduated with a strong academic record of 82.16%.
            I have a good knowledge and hands-on experience with Java, React.js and C, along with a good understanding
            of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Database Management Systems (DBMS).</p>
    </section>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q2">
        <h2>2. Tell me about your family background</h2>
        <p>I come from a supportive family. My father is a retired government school teacher, and my mother is a
            dedicated homemaker. I also have three elder sisters, and we share a strong bond of support and
            encouragement.</p>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q3">
        <h2>3. What is your biggest failure</h2>
        <p>One of failure occurred during my college group presentation. I was responsible for a specific section and
            focused entirely on perfecting my part, assuming that the rest of the presentation would come together
            naturally. I didn't prioritize communication with my teammates or coordinate our transitions. When we
            completed the presentation, we realize that the flow wasn’t smooth, some points were repeated, while some
            were skipped, which left us feeling disappointed as a team. It was an experience that highlighted the
            critical importance of collaboration and communication in group settings.</p>
    </section>
    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q4">
        <h2>4. What is your biggest challenge</h2>
        <p>The recent challenge I faced involved managing a very tight schedule during my mid-semester exams. My mid-sem
            exam started on October 26, and I had an NPTL exam on Sunday. On top of that, I have the interview scheduled
            for today. With such a packed timeline, I had to carefully manage my time to ensure I could perform well in
            all these commitments. After my mid-sem exam today, I have to rush from college to attend the interview. To
            handle this challenge, I prioritized my study sessions and made sure to stay organized with my schedule.</p>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q5">
        <h2>5. What is your strength</h2>
        <p>One of my greatest strengths is my problem-solving ability. I’m able to stay calm under pressure and break
            down complex problems into manageable steps. For instance, during a recent group project, we encountered a
            major compatibility issue when merging different components. Then we took a systematic approach to analyze
            the problem, consult with team members, and test different solutions. Ultimately, we were able to resolve
            the issue and complete the project.</p>
    </section>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q6">
        <h2>6. What is your weakness</h2>
        <p>One of my weaknesses is sometimes underestimating how long tasks will take, especially when it involves new
            or complex work. I tend to be optimistic with timelines, which can occasionally lead to last-minute rushes.
            To address it, I’ve started breaking down tasks into smaller steps and setting buffer time for unexpected
            issues.</p>
    </section>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q7">
        <h2>7. What is your least favorite subject in your academy</h2>
        <p>My least favorite subject in my academic experience was Computer Organization and Architecture, which I took
            in my first semester. Initially, I found it challenging because it focused heavily on the hardware
            architecture of computers, including the CPU, memory, and cache. I struggled to see the relevance of the
            subject and why it was important. After discussing it with one of my seniors, I understood how computers
            work internally is crucial for designing efficient algorithms to solve problems. This perspective developed
            a genuine interest in that subject.</p>
    </section>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q8">
        <h2>8. How do you keep yourself motivated when you feel low</h2>
        <p>I believe it’s completely normal to feel low or unmotivated sometimes. I first take a moment to relax my
            mind. Physical activity, like going for a walk or gym, also boosts my mood and clears my mind. Talking to
            friends or family for support is also a great way to gain encouragement.</p>
    </section>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q9">
        <h2>9. What is the motivating factor for you at work</h2>
        <p>I am motivated by achieving my goals and seeing the positive impact my work has on both my team and the
            overall project. Additionally, knowing that my contributions help the team succeed and create value for the
            organization.</p>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q10">
        <h2>10. What do you know about the company</h2>
        <p>Accenture is a global professional services company known for providing a broad range of services in
            technology, consulting, and operations. The headquarters is located in Dublin, Ireland. It operates in over
            120 countries with around 774,000 employees worldwide and serves clients from various industries.</p>
    </section>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q11">
        <h2>11. Why do you want to join Accenture</h2>
        <p>I want to join Accenture because of its reputation for innovation and its commitment to helping clients
            navigate complex digital transformations. I’m excited about working in an environment that focuses on
            continuous learning and emphasizes the importance of staying ahead with cutting-edge technology, which
            aligns well with my passion for tech and problem-solving.</p>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q12">
        <h2>12. Tell me about your projects</h2>
        <p>The most recent project I worked on is Evehunt, a mobile application designed to connect event-related
            service providers with customers. The app simplifies the process of booking services for events such as
            weddings, parties, and other occasions. Evehunt was developed using React Native, allowing for a smooth user
            interface, making it easier for users to find and book service providers efficiently. The idea for the
            project was inspired by my elder sister's wedding, where we faced challenges in organizing services like
            tent houses, catering, and decoration.</p>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q13">
        <h2>13. What is your role in the group project</h2>
        <p>In our group project, my primary role was developing the vendor account verification process. I implemented
            features such as real-time face selfie for biometric verification and phone OTP verification, using Firebase
            Storage and Firebase Phone Auth. This involved setting up user-friendly authentication processes. My work
            required collaboration with the team to integrate these features smoothly into the application.</p>
    </section>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q14">
        <h2>14. What challenges did you face in the project</h2>
        <p>In our project, Evehunt, we encountered both technical and non-technical challenges. A significant
            non-technical challenge was compatibility issues when merging the different components developed by our team
            members. Each of us had slightly different coding styles, which led to conflicts during integration. To
            address this, we adopted a standardized coding structure, and we shared our code on GitHub regularly to keep
            everyone updated and aligned.
            The main technical challenge was storing images using GraphQL, which proved complex and inefficient for
            handling media files. After assessing various options, we decided to store images in Firebase instead.
            Firebase offered a more flexible and scalable solution for our media storage needs.</p>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q15">
        <h2>15. How do you assign work in a group project</h2>
        <p>In our team projects, we focus on collaborating on members' strengths. We start by planning together to
            understand project goals and determine the skills needed for each part. We then divide roles based on
            individual strengths. We’re always ready to support each other and adjust responsibilities as needed to keep
            the project on track.</p>
    </section>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q16">
        <h2>16. What are your thoughts after working in a team</h2>
        <p>After working in a team, I believe that collaboration is essential for achieving success. Teamwork often
            leads to more creative solutions and better outcomes than working alone. I appreciate the importance of
            clear communication and mutual support, as they help to build trust and enhance productivity.</p>
    </section>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q17">
        <h2>17. Was there any conflict in your team</h2>
        <p>Yes, there was a conflict in my team during a hackathon. As we approached the deadline, the situation became
            more anxious, and some team members began blaming each other for not completing major parts of the project.
            We realized that this blame game was interrupting our progress. Then we decided to refocus our energy and
            agreed to prioritize completing the frontend tasks first, which would allow us to showcase a functional
            version of our project to the evaluators.</p>

            efficiently. My responsibilities include setting clear objectives, assigning tasks based on each member’s
            strengths, and ensuring open communication within the team. I also focus on tracking progress and providing
            constructive feedback to help team members to grow and improve. Additionally, I make it a priority to
            resolve any conflicts that arise.</p>
    </section>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q19">
        <h2>19. If you are a team lead and get stuck, how do you handle it</h2>
        <p>If I find myself stuck as a team lead, my first step is to break down the issue, identifying where the
            roadblock is. Then I communicate with the team members to resolve the problem. If needed, I’ll also reach
            out to mentors or consult external resources for guidance.</p>

    <section onclick="window.location.href='#home'" id="q20">
